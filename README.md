# Earthquake Challenge Module 14

## Purpose

We've created an earthquake map, but now we want to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location and see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map. 

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map
